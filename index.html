											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My name is Adam Wise and I am a PhD Candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow
										at the University of California, Berkeley. I sit in the Civil and Environmental
										Engineering department and am advised by Professor Tina Chow. My research focuses on 
										multiscale atmospheric modeling applied to wind energy. In addition to my academics, I 
										am an Engineering Intern at the floating offshore wind start-up Aikido Technologies in 
										San Francisco, CA. Prior to starting my PhD, 
										I was a Fulbright Scholar and Researcher in the Department of Marine Technology at the
										Norwegian University of Science and Technology advised by Professor Erin Bachynski-Polić.
										There, I studied wake meandering effects on floating offshore wind turbines. In 2018, 
										I completed my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Tech with a 
										minor in Naval Engineering as an Honors Scholar. As an undergrad, I spent the 2015-2016 
										academic year as an exchange student in Lund University, Sweden.</p>
										<p>I am actively seeking postdoctoral or industry positions beginning in the summer or fall of 2024.</p>

									<h2>Research</h2>
								</header>
								<p align="left">My research interests range from structural dynamics to atmospheric physics, largely for wind energy applications. I especially appreciate research that bridges the gap of atmospheric boundary layer flows and wind turbine design. Here are a few broad areas that I am interested in:
								</p>
								<ul align="left">
									<li>Boundary layer meteorology and numerical weather prediction</li>
									<li>Multi-scale atmospheric modeling coupling mesoscale and microscale parameterizations</li>
									<li>Turbulence parameterizations: Large-eddy simulation closures and synthetic turbulence generation</li>
									<li>Wind turbine and wind farm wakes</li>
								</ul>
								<p align="left">Below are a few major research areas that I have worked on:</p>
								<ul style="list-style: none;">
									<li>
										<h3>Floating Offshore Wind</h3>
										<span class="image"><center><img style="width: 75%; auto" src="images/FlowVisualizations.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
										<p>FWTs have long natural periods in certain degrees of freedom and the large-scale movement of the wake, known as wake meandering, occurs at very low frequencies. How the wake meanders can depend on the turbulence generation method and the coherent turbulent structures. We find that wake meandering at low wind speeds affect yaw motions, but that the reduction at wind speed in the wake changes quasi-steady mooring line and tower base loads and is the main driver of fatigue loading.</p>
										<p>The start of this work was completed during my year as a Fulbright Scholar at NTNU. The work was continued by an NTNU PhD student and resulted in a Berkeley-NTNU collaboration during my PhD. See Wise and Bachysnki 2020, Rivera-Arreba et al. 2022, Rivera-Arreba et al. 2022.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>Flows in Complex Terrain</h3>
										<span class="image"><center><img style="width: 75%; auto" src="images/3D_stable.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>Terrain-induced flow phenomena modulate wind turbine performance and wake behavior in ways that are not adequately accounted for in typical wind turbine wake and wind plant design models. This terrain-induced turbulence dominates the turbulent structures that interact with wind turbines and their wakes. To investigate wake behavior in complex terrain, we simulate the Perdigão field campaign in WRF-LES during representative convective and stable conditions. We find that during a convective case study, the wind wind turbine wake deflects upwards over a recirculation zone. During a stable case study, the wake follows the terrain along with a mountain wave. See Wise et al. 2022.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h3>Stable Boundary Layer Turbulence</h3>
										<span class="image"><center><img style="width: 75%; auto" src="images/plan_DRM_KP.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>Stable boundary layers are notoriously difficult to simulate due to the small turbulent length-scales that dominate. To resolve the small-scale turbulent structures, large-eddy simulation must be run at very fine resolutions, which is computationally expensive. I use dynamic turbulence modeling, which is less dissipative and thus able resolve turbulence at coarser resolutions than typical closures. This work is ongoing and part of the AWAKEN field campaign.</p>

									<h2>Teaching</h2>
								</header>
								<p align="left">I really enjoy teaching, helping, and interacting with students. I have been a graduate
									student instructor (GSI) for CEE 200A (Environmental Fluid Mechanics) and below are some examples of 
									feedback I received:</p>
								<ul align="left">
									<li>"You've been super helpful & patient. Thanks!!"</li>
									<li>"You're doing a great job. Really appreciate it."</li>
									<li>"You're the best!"</li>
									<li>"Best GSI!"</li>
								</ul>
								<p align="left"> I received an Outstanding GSI award for my teaching of 200A. 
									Additionally, I have also served as a research mentor and advisor to an undergraduate student 
									as part of the UC LEADS program.</p>
